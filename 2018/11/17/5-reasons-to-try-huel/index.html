		<p>For the last two months I’ve replaced one to two meals each day with Huel – a convenient (if monotonous) powdered food that can provide you with your complete recommended daily nutrition. Here are five of the biggest perks I’ve discovered.<!--more--></p>

<p>I was originally planning on writing about Huel as an off-topic post, but I figured it’s generated enough interest within techy circles to be considered technology-related. I’ve been using it for about two months now, and have been pleasantly surprised by my experience.</p>

<p>First, though, those who haven’t heard all the fuss might be wondering what <a href="https://uk.huel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Huel</a> actually is. Put simply, Huel is a meal replacement. It’s a powder you add to water to create a porridge-like mix. Its creators claim that around four portions a day amount to 100 per cent of your recommended nutrition, with the proper measures of vitamins, calories, and everything else.</p>

<p>The idea of a meal replacement had always interested me – especially since I began working as a <a href="https://mattcasmith.net/2018/09/07/seven-tips-new-cyber-security-consultants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cyber security consultant</a> and cooking became less convenient because I was travelling more. But even when Huel slowly began to take over my office, I didn’t get around to subscribing until one of my colleagues gave me a £10 off voucher at the start of September.</p>

<p>My first bottle of Huel did not go down smoothly. My body didn’t like the taste and consistency at all, and it was a struggle to finish. That was the last time I had any trouble, though, and I slowly transitioned to an average of two Huel meals a day, depending on how busy I am, how much I feel like cooking, and how much I’m craving “real food” at any given time.</p>

<p>It’s now two months since I began drinking Huel. Here are five great things I’ve learnt about Huel in that time, and why I can’t see myself looking back any time soon.</p>

<h3 id="1-huel-is-extremely-convenient">1. Huel is extremely convenient</h3>

<p>Measuring and mixing Huel takes approximately a minute. Rinsing the bottle out takes less than that. Even added together, that’s much less time than almost any other meal consumes. Unlike a lot of other foods, Huel is also portable. When I was taking <a href="https://mattcasmith.net/2018/10/19/sans-for500-windows-forensic-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my recent SANS course</a>, I took a pre-mixed bottle of Huel to the venue each day so I could have a quick meal before <a href="https://mattcasmith.net/2018/09/22/approaching-incident-response-on-the-front-foot-with-the-harm-method/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attending one of the evening talks</a> or competing in the NetWars capture the flag competition. When I’m travelling for work, I take Huel so I can eat either before I leave the office or when I’m on the train so I have more time to relax when I get home.</p>

<h3 id="2-huel-can-help-you-save-money">2. Huel can help you save money</h3>

<p>As you can probably imagine, eating Huel on the road also saves money. If I’m going away for a few days on a job, I take a few plastic containers full of pre-measured powder so I have meals ready to go. If I’m going to the office, I’ll pre-mix some Huel in the morning and take it with me. All this means I’m spending less money on lunches out, and less time on preparing packed lunches. Even if I don’t actually take any Huel with me when I go somewhere, knowing that there’s a quick, easy-to-make meal waiting for me at home makes me far less likely to pick something up in the evening before I travel back to my flat.</p>

<h3 id="3-huel-makes-nutrition-easier">3. Huel makes nutrition easier</h3>

<p>As well as worrying less about money and preparation, Huel makes it easy to eat a balanced diet. I’ve always been quite skinny and normally find it hard to put on more weight, but since I’ve been on Huel I’m fairly certain I’ve gained a little bit. This is a byproduct of Huel’s measured nature – I’m eating exact portions of nutritionally-balanced food, after all – but also that fact that preparation time is no longer an issue. No matter what I’m doing, how I’m feeling, or how busy I am, it only takes a few minutes to make and drink a bottle of Huel, meaning that it’s far less likely I’ll ever miss a meal than it was before.</p>

<h3 id="4-huel-makes-real-food-more-enjoyable">4. Huel makes “real food” more enjoyable</h3>

<p>If there’s one downside to Huel, it’s that it can become very monotonous. The Huel website has a blog post about several people eating <a href="https://uk.huel.com/pages/one-month-on-huel-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nothing but Huel for 30 days</a> to prove its nutritional worth, but I could never do that – it’s just too boring. However, the flip side of this is that when I _do _eat “real food” I enjoy it a lot more than I did previously. Sometimes I’ll visit an Italian or Japanese restaurant with my colleagues, and I appreciate the tastes and textures of these foods immensely now they’re not “just another meal”. Looking forward to one of these treats and then finally tucking in has become a great pleasure.</p>

<h3 id="5-huel-creates-less-rubbish">5. Huel creates less rubbish</h3>

<p>On top of the other benefits, switching to Huel has also reduced the amount of waste I produce considerably. I get through roughly one bag a week, meaning that unless I’ve eaten something else in that time the only item that goes into my bin each week is one empty Huel bag (and maybe a few coffee pods). From a personal perspective this means fewer trips out to the bin room, but of course the bigger picture is that it means less waste for landfill.</p>
