		<p>I got my first new laptop in six years this week! The new hardware is definitely exciting, but reviews aren’t really my thing, so while I’ll inevitably <a href="https://twitter.com/mattcasmith" target="_blank">tweet</a> about how the Microsoft Surface Laptop fares, that’s not the purpose of this post. This is more about the mundane job of porting all my usual applications over to a new PC, and a handy new Windows feature that helped to make things a little easier - <code>winget</code>.</p>

<p>Before we get started, I want to acknowledge both that I’m <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/winget-how-to-use-windows-10s-new-native-package-manager/" target="_blank">late to the party</a> on <code>winget</code> and that there have been <a href="https://chocolatey.org/" target="_blank">package managers</a> around on Windows for years - but it’s certainly a cool and useful addition to the core operating system, which bucks the trend when you consider how frequently Microsoft <em>removes</em> more advanced features and options these days (or at least applies confusing double UIs).</p>

<p>I’ll also concede that taking the time to write a PowerShell script to automate software deployment is probably overkill for most users - myself included. The time spent on development and testing is <em>probably</em> greater than the amount of time it would take to download and install each package individually, but at the end of the day I now have a pre-baked script I can use to drop my software on any future systems.</p>

<h3 id="initial-research">Initial research</h3>

<p>Before I even got as far as creating a <code>PS1</code> file, my first step was to do some research to identify the software packages I wanted to install. To achieve this, I used the following <code>winget</code> command.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="n">winget</span> <span class="n">search</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">APP_NAME</span><span class="o">&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This ran a search across all the configured repositories (by default, basically the Microsoft Store and <code>winget</code>’s own one). The most important details were in the <code>Id</code> column, which generally follows the format <code>Developer.Product</code>. There were a lot of third-party apps that had the names of popular software in their own names, so this helped to sort the wheat from the chaff and identify the real packages.</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/winget_0.png" /></p>

<p>During this planning stage, I considered the software I wanted to deploy to my new system and ran the <code>winget search</code> command to find the corresponding packages until I had a complete list.</p>

<h3 id="the-powershell-script">The PowerShell script</h3>

<p>Now I could start writing a PowerShell script to iterate through my list of applications and try to install each of them. Firstly, I created an array to store the list (note that only the <code>Id</code> values here match the repository data - the names are my own more readable ones, for display and logging only).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="err">$</span><span class="n">install_apps</span> <span class="o">=</span> 
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Firefox"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Mozilla.Firefox"</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Steam"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Valve.Steam"</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Discord"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Discord.Discord"</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Netflix"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"9WZDNCRFJ3TJ"</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Spotify"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"Spotify.Spotify"</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Next, I used a <code>foreach</code> loop to work through each application in <code>$install_apps</code> and attempt to run <code>winget</code> to install the corresponding package according to its <code>Id</code>, using the <code>--silent</code> flag to keep output to a minimum and require as little user interaction as possible to complete the deployment.</p>

<p>There are a number of reasons why installation of any given application might fail - a missing package or insufficient permissions to name just a couple. To prevent missing software from flying under the radar, I used an <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statement based on the <code>winget</code> exit code (<code>$LASTEXITCODE</code>) to detect any issues.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="n">foreach</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="n">app</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="err">$</span><span class="n">install_apps</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">Write</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Host</span> <span class="s">"Installing"</span> <span class="err">$</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="s">"..."</span>
    <span class="n">winget</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">silent</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="nb">id</span> <span class="err">$</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="err">$</span><span class="n">LASTEXITCODE</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">eq</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">Write</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Host</span> <span class="err">$</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="s">"installation complete."</span>
        <span class="n">Write</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Host</span> <span class="s">""</span>
    <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="n">Write</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Host</span> <span class="err">$</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="s">"installation failed."</span>
        <span class="n">Write</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">Host</span> <span class="s">""</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And that’s pretty much all I needed to get going! I also added a section to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (with Ubuntu) and a few extra lines to log failures to a file (in case I missed them in the terminal), but the code above would be perfectly adequate to try to install all the packages in the given list.</p>

<h3 id="the-results">The results</h3>

<p>So how did things go with the new laptop? Did my <code>winget</code> PowerShell script solve all my problems and allow me to kick back and relax as my applications were automatically deployed to my new system?</p>

<p>Well, to tell the complete truth, not quite… But it was very close.</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/winget_1.png" /></p>

<p>As you can see from the screenshot above, <code>winget</code> undoubtedly made the job much quicker and easier, but it wasn’t <em>entirely</em> hands-off. Spotify was the only app that failed to install for some reason (perhaps because it’s one of those apps that come half-installed on a fresh Windows system?), but there were also a couple of others that required me to hit the <code>Y</code> key to accept licence agreements and terms of use.</p>

<p style="float: left; width: 90%; padding: 5px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 5%; margin: 30px 0 10px 0; font-style: italic; border-left: 5px solid #FFFF00; background: #FFFFB9; color: #333;">I eventually found a solution to this part of the issue - unfortunately just after I ran the script. You can accept licence agreements automatically by using the <code>--accept-source-agreements</code> and <code>--accept-package-agreements</code> parameters when running <code>winget</code>.</p>

<p>Still, it was a fun experiment, saved a lot of time downloading installers from developer websites and running them manually via the GUI, and leaves me with a script that will be easy to repurpose to (almost) automate the setup of any new computers I adopt in future. While <code>winget</code> isn’t the perfect zero-touch solution, I’d definitely recommend giving it a go - particularly if you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to set up multiple systems in a short time and a cheat code would help to preserve your sanity.</p>
