    <content type="html"><![CDATA[I first visited New York in 2024, and those few rain-drenched days left a deep impression on me. I did my lap of the usual tourist sights, but my affection for the place lay elsewhere. Something excited me about the city at street level - an inspirational energy that I... <a href="https://mattcasmith.net/2025/10/03/new-york-observations-recommendations">>>Read more</a>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[“You can just do things” has become common advice online. It’s a modern iteration on the ethos that fortune favours the brave - a proclamation that you’re only one bold move away from the life you’ve always dreamt of. Yeah right, was my initial reaction to the meme. You can’t... <a href="https://mattcasmith.net/2025/09/13/you-can-just-do-things-kind-of">>>Read more</a>]]></content>
