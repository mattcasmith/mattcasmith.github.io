It was exhausting, but it came with an unexpected side effect: it made me see those places differently. It’s hard to take your city for granted when you walk familiar streets with somebody seeing them for the first time. It snaps you out of your tunnel vision. But while it opened my eyes to details I usually overlook, visiting the hotspots also made me realise how hollow most modern travel really is. A view of a hotel in my hometown that dates back to 1830 - far from the London crowds My most memorable trips tend to leave a lasting impression because they offer a glimpse of life in a different place. That usually happens when I visit friends in their home countries. The highlights are rarely the popular sights, but parts of the local lifestyle that I want to adopt and bring home with me. Even when I don’t know anybody in town and spend more time on the beaten track, my takeaways often come from small details - the story behind an unusual item on a restaurant menu, or a museum exhibit that makes me think about how people used to live and the way the city evolved. That kind of encounter demands real engagement with a place - you learn something about the world, and it changes you. But city breaks increasingly seem like a checklist - the top ten Trip Advisor attractions, each dutifully photographed like digital collectables in an open-world video game. Beyond the photos and landmarks, it’s easy to miss the soul of a place entirely. That’s why parts of my London tour felt so disheartening. My guests got a small taste of London life, with some personal recommendations and home-cooked meals, but it’s hard to imagine anybody zig-zagging between tourist spots to compile their end-of-trip Instagram carousel ever would. And when the photo matters more than the moment, etiquette goes out the window. The city becomes a mere backdrop, in front of which dense crowds jostle for their 20 seconds posing against the railings. Nothing is really absorbed. Why bother, when everything’s already captured on disk? Photo opOne couple took things to a new extreme at Tower Bridge. I was standing next to a tree, waiting for my group to take in the view, when I noticed a woman about a metre away pointing her smartphone straight at me. I turned to see what she was aiming at, and realised her partner had quietly slipped in behind me to pose against the tree. Not a word was said - they simply assumed I would step aside. For a moment, I felt more like a member of staff at an amusement park than a citizen in my own city. Sadly, this outlook on travel also seems to be influencing the way our cities are being shaped. The classic London landmarks (the Houses of Parliament, the Tower of London, St. Paul’s Cathedral, and so on) were all primarily built for function - albeit with a healthy layer of beauty on top. It was coincidental that their history and aesthetics makes them worth visiting so much later. Most attractions built since the turn of the millennium (the London Eye, the Shard, the Sky Garden) are little more than glorified viewing platforms. Some might argue that we’ve simply forgotten how to build beautiful places, and that modern buildings are bland regardless of their purpose. But elevated points for tourists to take photos also seem to have taken precedence over the construction of aesthetically pleasing public infrastructure. Will we ever change course? Never say never, but it doesn’t look likely in the near future. Tourists are happy to visit somewhere offering a good photo opportunity, and those building these places make too much money - if not from admittance, which is sometimes free as a planning condition, from the gift shops and pricey restaurants and bars that are never too far away. Trends are hard to reverse, but there are personal antidotes. Travel is more rewarding when you embark on a trip with curiosity, rather than a checklist. Ask questions, linger longer, read the plaques, and treat your destination as somebody’s home - not a product. You’ll be infinitely more likely to pick up on the details that make the whole endeavour worthwhile.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://mattcasmith.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tourism_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://mattcasmith.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tourism_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Staying productive when everything feels urgent</title><link href="https://mattcasmith.net/2025/05/02/time-blocking-productivity" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Staying productive when everything feels urgent" /><published>2025-05-02T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-05-02T01:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://mattcasmith.net/2025/05/02/time-blocking-productivity</id><author><name>mattcasmith</name></author><summary type="html">We’ve all been there. One day you’re in control, the next you’re racing from meeting to meeting, unable to focus long enough to move anything forward in any meaningful way - unless, that is, you start protecting your time. When everything feels urgent and your calendar is under siege, the key to making progress lies in consciously carving out space for what matters most. A snowballing workload Years ago, I was a pure practitioner. I had a manageable amount of work and a nice clear schedule to complete it in. If the volume of tasks exceeded the number of hours in the day, I could simply inform my manager and they’d resolve the equation, either with more people or a streamlined backlog. But progress far enough in any career and that won’t last long. My expanded workload now consists not only of the doing itself, but also of strategising, planning, administrating, and managing - and with those responsibilities come all the related meetings, leaving my calendar much more crowded. This conundrum isn’t reserved for management types alone. As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, technology roles are becoming more demanding across the board. Companies are trying to do more with less, retracting perks and burdening workers with responsibilities that were previously spread across multiple roles, all in the name of “agility”. That out-of-control feeling is triggered by the absence of agency. You're on the hook for the work, but lack the authority to do anything There are few feelings worse than when the scales tip and your inbox is suddenly filling up more quickly than you can empty it. That out-of-control feeling is triggered by a perceived - and possibly real - absence of agency. You don’t have enough time to do everything you’re on the hook for, but you lack the authority to turn down work or bring in additional people to help. Even considering what to focus on first only burns more time. If your normal working hours are not enough to get everything done, it may be tempting to stay late to bring your to-do list under control - but will that actually help in the long run, or will it only mean you’re less productive tomorrow due to the resulting fatigue? It can feel like an insurmountable challenge. Working within constraints A typical recommendation to get ahead of this chaos is to take the time to note down your most important tasks for the day. Entrepreneur and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, for example, is often cited for his approach of scribbling his three to five most pressing tasks on an index card just before he goes to bed, ready to begin the next day on the front foot. The thinking here makes obvious sense. Your time is finite and in a modern business environment there is always a lot going on. Therefore it is optimal to focus on a small number of actions that will make the most impact, and recording these in advance will help you to avoid trivial distractions. However, there are obvious issues with this approach if you’re not a self-employed founder or a C-level leader with full control over your calendar: It’s likely that you’ll receive urgent tasks from your manager or your customers, and not checking your emails until midday because you were engaging in focused work probably isn’t going to cut it. As a low- or mid-level employee, your time is not seen as sacred. People will see spare slots in your calendar and fill them, leaving you with no time to get on with the things on your high-priority list. Therefore while you might start the day with the best intentions, it’s very easy for things to descend into the kind of firefighting you sought to avoid. The solution: Prioritisation + time blocking Over time, I have settled on a straightforward approach that minimises the risk of that happening. The following tactic has emerged naturally for me over years - partly as a product of my inclination towards organisation, but also as a custom hybrid of various productivity systems out there online. I bolster the prioritisation system touted by gurus like Andreessen with time blocking. This means I not only identify the day’s most important tasks, but I also protect the time needed to get my head down and complete them. Together, task prioritisation and time blocking make high workloads more manageable At the beginning of each day, I review my calendar. Inevitably, some of my time is already reserved for meetings. Those were subject to filtering prior to accepting the invites1, and generally stay where they are. Then I turn to my to-do list. Working in order of priority, I estimate how long each task is likely to take and block out time on my calendar, as close to the start of the day as possible. I bundle small tasks (e.g. email replies) into a single block to avoid overcomplicating things and wasting time. I am careful not to book back-to-back tasks through the entire duration of the day. A spare 30-minute block here and there provides the opportunity to catch up on overrunning tasks and deal with any interruptions, new urgent requests, or personal emergencies that crop up. A ring-fenced lunch break is also non-negotiable - nobody can work for eight or more hours straight.2 Benefits of the hybrid system It’s a simple system - anything more intricate would risk consuming more of my time than it saved - but blocking out time in this way has a surprising number of direct and indirect benefits to my focus and productivity: I have time to do the things that matter. With my calendar already booked, it is unlikely that anyone will push additional meeting invites, meaning a greater overall productivity-to-meeting ratio. My IM status is automatically set to Busy. People are less likely to interrupt my focused work if that little circle is red rather than green. The cognitive load of selecting tasks is removed. There is a cognitive penalty to task switching, and time blocking not only allows me to focus on a single task for a set period, but also removes the need to consider what to do next. The next block arrives, and the next task is there ready to go, making it easier to maintain momentum.3 When interruptions do occur, they impact low-priority work. By frontloading my day with the most important work, other urgent tasks that “must be completed by COP” can be handled by pushing low-priority blocks further out. The big stuff still gets done. The prioritisation element ensures high-impact work is at the top of the pile, while time blocking ensures my colleagues - and my brain - know I’m focused on something and should only be interrupted for urgent matters. Together, they’re effective in restoring productivity and taking back control of my day. Your calendar is a reflection of your priorities. Make it intentional. Notes and references Never be afraid to decline a meeting invite if you think all the necessary information could be provided in a quick email. I’ve found a good tactic is to set my lunch block to 45 minutes. This defends my lunch time, ensuring I always have time to rest and eat. But also, because nobody books 15-minute meetings, it buys me some time to catch up on my inbox before the next block. I’m acutely aware that turning complex knowledge work into something akin to a factory assembly line could also be viewed as a criticism of this approach. It won’t be for everyone.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://mattcasmith.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/productivity-time-blocking_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://mattcasmith.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/productivity-time-blocking_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Humanising AI encourages intellectual lethargy</title><link href="https://mattcasmith.net/2025/04/21/chatgpt-ai-anthropomorphism" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Humanising AI encourages intellectual lethargy" /><published>2025-04-21T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-04-21T01:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://mattcasmith.net/2025/04/21/chatgpt-ai-anthropomorphism</id><author><name>mattcasmith</name></author><summary type="html">I recently stumbled upon a Hacker News thread around a series of X posts about ChatGPT’s o3 model. Researchers noted that it “frequently fabricates actions it never took, and then elaborately justifies those actions when confronted”, in one case claiming to have received an incorrect result by running code on a laptop that it couldn’t possibly have had access to. “These behaviours are surprising,” Transluce wrote later in their thread. “It seems that despite being incredibly powerful at solving math and coding tasks, o3 is not by default truthful about its capabilities.” Yes, I did use AI to generate this image They theorised that these discrepencies are caused by the way ChatGPT handles conversations with multiple prompts and replies. Because the model cannot see the reasoning behind each previous response, it can only base future responses on the content of past replies. Lacking the context to know how they were generated, it sometimes makes up stories to fill the blanks. While this has interesting technical implications, some of the most interesting discussion on Hacker News was around the use of moral terms like “truthful” in relation to an AI model. One user, latexr, replied: “It is only surprising to those who refuse to understand how [large language models] work and continue to anthropomorphise them. There is no being ‘truthful’ here, the model has no concept of right or wrong, true or false. It’s not ‘lying’ to you, it’s spitting out text. It just so happens that sometimes that non-deterministic text aligns with reality, but you don’t really know when and neither does the model.” Your new best friend That person is correct, but the underlying issue is that technology companies increasingly try to hide that their products are simply complex systems, incapable of conscious thought. It’s not only ChatGPT that lacks knowledge of how its responses are generated - the user doesn’t see its workings either. Replies are wrapped in a layer of flowery, friendly language. In extreme cases, this leads to Her-esque stories of people falling in love with AI personas. But even for the regular user, it implies human-style reasoning and sets an expectation that the content of responses is more reliable than it really is. The royal weThere is precedent for attempting to convince users a soulless software product is a helpful assistant. From about 2017, between Windows 10 and 11, Microsoft implemented a tone shift that involved a jarring change of perspective. What were straightforward, efficient messages (&quot;Windows has encountered an error&quot;) suddenly became overly friendly (&quot;We're getting things ready for you&quot;, &quot;We need to restart&quot;). In that case it felt rather manipulative, as if Microsoft thought I might be more acceptant of its products' shortcomings if I felt like we were working as a team to tackle them. Intellectual lethargy Google search results have generally become less useful over the last decade, but the difference is that users expect they’ll need to apply their own logic and filters to whatever comes back. Scanning a page of results triggers an automatic mental assessment of each site’s reliability, and the answer to the user’s query is often an amalgamation of content from several links. Through a combination of hype and framing, AI models set a very different expectation. ChatGPT is positioned as the user’s trusted assistant, and it is therefore a fair assumption that it has already done the legwork to evaluate the information presented by each source and return the ultimate truth. Users expect they'll need to apply their own logic and filters to Google search results, but ChatGPT uses a tone that implies human-style reasoning This mostly holds true, but unburdened by the task of evaluating results themselves, the user is no longer in a critical state of mind. The combination of a single answer, the model’s human-like tone, and its confident rebuttal of challenges even when it’s in the wrong makes detecting errors - or as they’ve come to be known in online tech circles, “hallucinations” - not only a more challenging task, but one that is probably not front-of-mind for most users. In casual use cases that’s mostly a nuisance. But where AI is used in more professional applications, integrated within more complex systems, or used as part of efforts to control online narratives through censorship of results, the removal of any expectation of mental engagement on the part of the user becomes more of a problem - and one that will only increase in prevalence as LLM user bases grow and more people come to trust their chirpy tone.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://mattcasmith.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-humanisation_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://mattcasmith.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ai-humanisation_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Finding comfort in the green hills outside my window</title><link href="https://mattcasmith.net/2025/04/16/green-hills-outside-my-window" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Finding comfort in the green hills outside my window" /><published>2025-04-16T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-04-16T01:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://mattcasmith.net/2025/04/16/hills-outside-my-window</id><author><name>mattcasmith</name></author><summary type="html">As I mentioned in a recent post, I moved to a new home a few months ago. My new place sits atop a hill, and the window to the right of my desk happens to look away from the city, over the tops of the houses opposite and off into the green hills beyond. I can see all the way to the trees on the horizon. It’s a shame that I can’t post a photo without the risk of doxxing myself. I wouldn’t say it’s especially picturesque. You wouldn’t put it on a postcard - the electricity pylons and roads are a firm reminder that this is not, in fact, the countryside. But those rolling - albeit cluttered - hills are still a welcome contrast to the density of the City and the grime of the local high street. ChatGPT's approximation of my view, with exaggerated greenery - Ghiblified, naturally I feel as though that view keeps me in touch with nature, if only by a strand. On frosty mornings, the greenery takes on a pale hue. When the rainclouds roll in, the hills disappear behind a sheet of grey mist. On sunny days, I can see the shadows cast by the clouds drifting across the landscape. And in the bright spring evenings, my wife and I watch some fantastic sunsets disappear over the horizon, bathing our living room in golden light on the way. Until I moved, I didn’t realise how much I was missing without this light and airiness. For seven years, I lived in a studio flat that faced west. My view was of the wall of the building opposite. In the winter, the sun often didn’t reach my window at all, setting before it moved far enough around in the sky. And even in the summer, it was partially obstructed by the tree cover outside. If all you can see is man-made structures, then it feels impossible to look past man-made problems. If all you can see is man-made structures, then it feels impossible to look past man-made problems. My distant view of the landscape is a reminder of the true constants - the hills, the weather - that continue to exist no matter what we build on top. For thousands of years, people have observed them in the same way. That’s a calming thought in the face of day-to-day stresses. When I bought the place, the view barely factored into my decision - it was just a nice bonus. But after living here for a while, I think green sightlines have become a greater consideration if I ever decide to move again. It’s almost as though humans weren’t built to stare at grey tarmac every day.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://mattcasmith.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/green-hills_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://mattcasmith.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/green-hills_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Fixing weak WiFi and slow speeds on my home network</title><link href="https://mattcasmith.net/2025/04/08/home-network-weak-wifi-slow-speeds" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fixing weak WiFi and slow speeds on my home network" /><published>2025-04-08T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-04-08T01:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://mattcasmith.net/2025/04/08/home-networking-weak-wifi-slow-speeds</id><author><name>mattcasmith</name></author><summary type="html">I moved to a new home late last year, and immediately faced a whole range of connectivity issues. For a techie like myself, reliant on a functional network both for work and for fun, that was a big problem. So I implemented a few different solutions to find a fix (some of which were arguably overkill). It all started when I realised that my previous fibre broadband provider didn’t offer service to my new building. After searching for a replacement, the best option seemed to be Virgin Media. I signed up for their 500Mbps package, plugged in the router they provided, and thought I was set. How wrong I was. Even from my early visits to my new flat, camping out on the floor of the empty bedroom and waiting for Ikea deliveries, it was clear something was wrong. My phone stumbled along at 20Mbps, and frequently disconnected from the WiFi altogether. Streaming a football match or a Formula 1 race to entertain myself during those long waits was impossible. I initially put it down to teething issues. I had just activated the connection, and I assumed it was midway through some kind of adjustment process, after which it would reach optimal speeds. But days turned into weeks, weeks into months, and I decided I needed to dig into what was going on. Diagnosing the issue Through a combination of observation, research, trial, and error, I worked out that there were two main reasons behind the poor network performance. First was that my new building was simply very noisy. A quick glance at a NetSpot report revealed tens of networks in the near vicinity, spread across all available channels. While not the end of the world, this meant that sometimes my WiFi signal was probably simply being drowned out. My second discovery was that the Virgin Media Hub 3 is notoriously bad. It has been around for six years at the time of writing, and the internet is full of complaints from people in exactly my situation who expected a decent WiFi signal but had nothing but trouble with speeds and reliability. Unfortunately, if its full signal strength couldn’t shout over the noise, it wasn’t ever going to be enough on its own. The cable outlet was located in my living room, so it would be a lot of effort to move the Hub to a more central location, and even if I did, there was no guarantee it would work. Fix #1: Ethernet connections Armed with the knowledge that my WiFi problems were probably unfixable, but with no time or backup kit, I implemented the easiest possible fix: connecting as many devices as possible directly to the router. This was a simple process for my PlayStation 5 - I just ran an ethernet cable around the living room skirting board. Reaching my home office took slightly more effort, as I needed to detach and reattach the connector to poke the cable through a hole in the wall to reach the router on the other side. Hooking the devices up directly gave me a first glimpse of the internet speeds I was paying for, with downloads consistently exceeding 500Mbps. However, this did nothing to solve my problems with mobile devices. In the bedroom, my iPhone still jumped between WiFi and 5G at random. More problematically, despite sitting only a metre or so from the Hub, my work laptop sometimes dropped out in the middle of Teams calls. Fix #2: Replacement router It was clear the Hub 3’s WiFi wasn’t up to scratch, so I bought the best router I could find in stock in my local area - an Asus TUF-AX3000 V2. This isn’t a router review, but I was pleasantly surprised. Besides looking like a cross between a brutalist building and an alien spacecraft, the TUF-AX3000 was very easy to set up - connecting almost immediately after I switched my Hub to modem-only mode - and boasts a flashy mobile app for network monitoring and management, with security backed by Trend Micro. The Asus TUF-AX3000 V2 router has a distinctly &quot;gamer&quot; look Most importantly, it uses WiFi 6, and instantly boosted my signal strength. From the moment I switched to the new router, my Teams calls worked flawlessly and connections seemed much more stable in general. It wasn’t perfect - connections could still drop sometimes in remote corners - but I found an easy solution, buying a longer ethernet cable and a power extension cord so I could position the router on top of a cabinet, away from any obstructions. Since then, the signal has been perfect everywhere. Fix #3: Ethernet switch With more reliable WiFi, I could have stopped there. But I wanted the best possible connection from my laptops, and that meant giving them a wired connection to the router when working at my desk. With only the one cable available in my office, I bought a little switch to allow multiple connections. I was expecting another chunky outlay, but I picked up a TP-Link TL-SG105 for about £15, making it one of the cheaper components in my setup. It’s a simple device - plug and play with no management interface - but I like how compact and sturdy it is, like a mini version of an enterprise rack switch. The TP-Link TL-SG105 switch is basic, but it's a neat little package The switch lets me connect multiple devices to the network via ethernet, meaning I can wire in both my desktop PC and the Microsoft Surface dock that provides power, networking, and USB ports to my laptops via a single connector. It was a fair bit of work, but the extra additions to my setup mean I’m now sorted with reliable 500Mbps+ speeds across all my devices. End result and next steps The new router and switch mean that my network, originally a standard hub-and-spoke model centred around the Virgin Media Hub, now looks a little more complex. Of course, that additional complexity also brings two new devices to power, maintain, and eventually replace, but it has drastically improved my experience without too much capital or overhead cost. My home network needed a small upgrade to work reliably across multiple rooms What’s next? Well, there are a whole load of projects I’d love to tackle now I’m more settled in one spot. Tinkering with an open-source smart home sounds like an attractive option, but even just being able to set up a Raspberry Pi project in a permanent position brings a lot of potential. But first, I need to take care of more practical matters - before I can even think about an IoT themostat, my new home needs a fresh coat of paint.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://mattcasmith.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/home-networking_0.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://mattcasmith.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/home-networking_0.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Endpoint detection and response (EDR) - setting the record straight</title><link href="https://mattcasmith.net/2024/07/20/crowdstrike-bug-edr-setting-record-straight" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Endpoint detection and response (EDR) - setting the record straight" /><published>2024-07-20T01:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-07-20T01:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://mattcasmith.net/2024/07/20/crowdstrike-bug-edr-setting-record-straight</id><author><name>mattcasmith</name></author><summary type="html">When I went to bed on the evening of Friday 19th July, I couldn’t sleep.

The new hardware is definitely exciting, but reviews aren’t really my thing, so while I’ll inevitably tweet about how the Microsoft Surface Laptop fares, that’s not the purpose of this post. This is more about the mundane job of porting all my usual applications over to a new PC, and a handy new Windows feature that helped to make things a little easier - winget. Before we get started, I want to acknowledge both that I’m late to the party on winget and that there have been package managers around on Windows for years - but it’s certainly a cool and useful addition to the core operating system, which bucks the trend when you consider how frequently Microsoft removes more advanced features and options these days (or at least applies confusing double UIs). I’ll also concede that taking the time to write a PowerShell script to automate software deployment is probably overkill for most users - myself included. The time spent on development and testing is probably greater than the amount of time it would take to download and install each package individually, but at the end of the day I now have a pre-baked script I can use to drop my software on any future systems. Initial research Before I even got as far as creating a PS1 file, my first step was to do some research to identify the software packages I wanted to install. To achieve this, I used the following winget command. winget search &amp;lt;APP_NAME&amp;gt; This ran a search across all the configured repositories (by default, basically the Microsoft Store and winget’s own one). The most important details were in the Id column, which generally follows the format Developer.Product. There were a lot of third-party apps that had the names of popular software in their own names, so this helped to sort the wheat from the chaff and identify the real packages. During this planning stage, I considered the software I wanted to deploy to my new system and ran the winget search command to find the corresponding packages until I had a complete list. The PowerShell script Now I could start writing a PowerShell script to iterate through my list of applications and try to install each of them. Firstly, I created an array to store the list (note that only the Id values here match the repository data - the names are my own more readable ones, for display and logging only). $install_apps = (&quot;Firefox&quot;, &quot;Mozilla.Firefox&quot;), (&quot;Steam&quot;, &quot;Valve.Steam&quot;), (&quot;Discord&quot;, &quot;Discord.Discord&quot;), (&quot;Netflix&quot;, &quot;9WZDNCRFJ3TJ&quot;), (&quot;Spotify&quot;, &quot;Spotify.Spotify&quot;) Next, I used a foreach loop to work through each application in $install_apps and attempt to run winget to install the corresponding package according to its Id, using the --silent flag to keep output to a minimum and require as little user interaction as possible to complete the deployment. There are a number of reasons why installation of any given application might fail - a missing package or insufficient permissions to name just a couple. To prevent missing software from flying under the radar, I used an if/else statement based on the winget exit code ($LASTEXITCODE) to detect any issues. foreach ($app in $install_apps) { Write-Host &quot;Installing&quot; $app[0] &quot;...&quot; winget install --silent --id $app[1] if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) { Write-Host $app[0] &quot;installation complete.&quot; Write-Host &quot;&quot; } else { Write-Host $app[0] &quot;installation failed.&quot; Write-Host &quot;&quot; } } And that’s pretty much all I needed to get going! I also added a section to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (with Ubuntu) and a few extra lines to log failures to a file (in case I missed them in the terminal), but the code above would be perfectly adequate to try to install all the packages in the given list. The results So how did things go with the new laptop? Did my winget PowerShell script solve all my problems and allow me to kick back and relax as my applications were automatically deployed to my new system? Well, to tell the complete truth, not quite… But it was very close. As you can see from the screenshot above, winget undoubtedly made the job much quicker and easier, but it wasn’t entirely hands-off. Spotify was the only app that failed to install for some reason (perhaps because it’s one of those apps that come half-installed on a fresh Windows system?), but there were also a couple of others that required me to hit the Y key to accept licence agreements and terms of use. I eventually found a solution to this part of the issue - unfortunately just after I ran the script. You can accept licence agreements automatically by using the --accept-source-agreements and --accept-package-agreements parameters when running winget. Still, it was a fun experiment, saved a lot of time downloading installers from developer websites and running them manually via the GUI, and leaves me with a script that will be easy to repurpose to (almost) automate the setup of any new computers I adopt in future. While winget isn’t the perfect zero-touch solution, I’d definitely recommend giving it a go - particularly if you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to set up multiple systems in a short time and a cheat code would help to preserve your sanity.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://mattcasmith.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/winget_1.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://mattcasmith.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/winget_1.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">2023: Thoughts on new challenges and sharing experiences</title><link href="https://mattcasmith.net/2023/01/13/2023-new-challenges-sharing-experiences" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2023&amp;#58; Thoughts on new challenges and sharing experiences" /><published>2023-01-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mattcasmith.net/2023/01/13/2023-new-challenges-sharing-experiences</id><author><name>mattcasmith</name></author><summary type="html">A belated happy new year! If you’re reading this, I hope you have a terrific 2023. I recently went back and read some old posts that have long since been deleted from this blog - writings from my journalism days that reminded me of my perspectives on certain news events and emerging technologies from the mid-2010s and sparked some nostalgia for my early twenties along the way. By the end of 2017, I’d landed a job in cyber security and the tone of my blog changed. Gone were the slightly rambling posts that gave a sense of personality, and what came was primarily content consisting of technical notes about things I’d been working on in Python or a particular forensic artefact (don’t get me wrong - I’m proud of many of these articles, and they remain a useful way of organising my thoughts). Reasons for retreating My change of industry played a role in this. Despite having reported on cyber security for four years beforehand, my hesitance over ranting about a sector I was quite new to in the same way I’d written about consumer technology was justified. Another factor was that my job just wasn’t as public - an interesting conversation or briefing as a journalist might make a good blog post if it didn’t fit my employer’s site, but accounts of incidents I work and security discussions with clients must stay behind closed doors. But there was also a force at play that was more toxic than humbleness or confidentiality: anxiety. I’d seen flashes of it before as I battled imposter syndrome on entering cyber security, but the real thing crept up on me during the COVID-19 pandemic, and I spent a good deal of 2022 pushing myself in various ways to get it under control. It still has its occasional moments, but I’m in a much better place heading into 2023. While keeping background stress as low as possible helped with this, I was also anxious in less of a clinical sense about writing. The less you put yourself out there, the less likely it is that you’ll be called out on something, or somebody will tell you that you’re wrong. Inertia is like laying in a safety net. Incremental improvement But if you’re sitting still on the net, paralysed out of fear of action and its consequences, you’ll never walk the tightrope. Sure, it’s far less likely that you’ll fail, but you’ll also never do anything remarkable. For all we know, the greatest ideas in history might not be the ones in modern day textbooks - they might never have made it that far, living and dying inside their creators’ heads because they were never shared. I doubt anything I write on these pages will change the world, and most of my ideas are iterations on or combinations of existing ones, rather than fully original thoughts. But even if I have nothing revolutonary to say, the little things that inspire me to put digital pen to paper could still be enough to make our small corner of the world a better place, even if it’s just a tip that saves someone else five minutes. Some changes in my life have put me what will hopefully be a far better place to trial ideas and implement change in 2023, and I intend to write some more personal, thoughtful posts to share my learnings from these experiments. I still might not be able to go into as much detail as I did a decade ago, but I’m feeling energetic, inspired, and more motivated to share my experiences than I have been in years. If you’re interested, check my blog regularly for new posts, and follow me on Twitter for day-to-day updates. Feel free to email me, too - it’s an exciting, optimistic time and I’d be happy to connect.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://mattcasmith.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mcas.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://mattcasmith.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mcas.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
