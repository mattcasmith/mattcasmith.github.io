    <content type="html"><![CDATA[On a recent trip to Austin, Texas, I was tempted to take one of the Waymos or Robotaxis that so casually roam the streets. One day, I was even offered one as an alternative to waiting 11 minutes for an Uber driver.

That was presumably the thinking when OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-augmented browser that it says will change the way we use the internet.
