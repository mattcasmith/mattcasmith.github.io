		<p>My blog has had a bit of a cyber security learning theme recently (I have a couple more posts lines up on the topic, too) and it’s only set to continue this week with a great free resource that I first learnt about at the SANS Cyber Retraining Academy.<!--more--></p>

<p>I’d never heard of it before, but Packt Publishing is a UK-based publisher specialising in IT that has released more than 6,000 books to help industry professionals learn about new technologies and boost their knowledge of the ones they’re already using.</p>

<p>The best bit – and the reason I’m writing this post – is that they offer <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a free ebook on their website every single day</a>. These expire daily, so you need to remember to check, and they’re not always strictly about cyber security, but you can’t argue with a free resource like this.</p>

<p>I’ve been quite lazy about checking their offerings since I learnt about the site more than a year ago, but since I returned a month or two ago I’ve picked up books including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <em>Advanced Machine Learning with Python</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Building Machine Learning Systems with Python</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>What You Need to Know About Machine Learning</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Hadoop Explained</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Practical Data Analysis</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Learning Python</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Mastering Python</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Python Data Structures and Algorithms</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Python High Performance</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Raspberry Pi Cookbook for Python Programmers</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>What You Need to Know About Python</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Creating Your MySQL Database</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Practical Web Development</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Thinking in CSS</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Thinking in HTML</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Thinking in JavaScript</em>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, there’s quite a variety and usually the focus is more on coding than security, but they’re usually pretty useful, and if you travel for work as much as I do then they’re great to have on your smartphone to make use of all of those train journeys.</p>

<p>On top of the daily free book, many of the titles listed above are also permanently free at the bottom of <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/packt/offers/free-learning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the download page</a>, so if you’re stuck for some technical reading then there’s bound to be something of interest available for you to pick up there.</p>

<p>It’s also worth keeping an eye out at <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humble Bundle</a>, which recently offered a bundle of more than ten Wiley cyber security ebooks for $15 (about £12). I’m currently reading <em>Threat Modelling: Designing for Security</em>, which I’ll post a review of when I’m done, and next on my list is <em>The Art of Memory Forensics</em>, which comes highly recommended from one of my colleagues.</p>

However, if you have thoughts to share I'd love to hear from you - feel free to send me <a href="https://twitter.com/mattcasmith" target="_blank">a tweet</a> or <a href="mailto:mattcasmith@protonmail.com">an email</a>.
