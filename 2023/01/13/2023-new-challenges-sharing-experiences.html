					<p>A belated happy new year! If youâ€™re reading this, I hope you have a terrific 2023.</p>

<p>I recently went back and read some old posts that have long since been deleted from this blog - writings from my journalism days that reminded me of my perspectives on certain news events and emerging technologies from the mid-2010s and sparked some nostalgia for my early twenties along the way.</p>

<p>By the end of 2017, Iâ€™d landed a job in cyber security and the tone of my blog changed. Gone were the slightly rambling posts that gave a sense of personality, and what came was primarily content consisting of technical notes about things Iâ€™d been working on in <a href="/category/programming">Python</a> or a particular <a href="/category/cyber-security">forensic artefact</a> (donâ€™t get me wrong - Iâ€™m proud of many of these articles, and they remain a useful way of organising my thoughts).</p>

<h3 id="reasons-for-retreating">Reasons for retreating</h3>

<p>My change of industry played a role in this. Despite having reported on cyber security for four years beforehand, my hesitance over ranting about a sector I was quite new to in the same way Iâ€™d written about consumer technology was justified. Another factor was that my job just wasnâ€™t as public - an interesting conversation or briefing as a journalist might make a good blog post if it didnâ€™t fit my employerâ€™s site, but accounts of incidents I work and security discussions with clients must stay behind closed doors.</p>

<p>But there was also a force at play that was more toxic than humbleness or confidentiality: anxiety. Iâ€™d seen flashes of it before as I battled imposter syndrome on entering cyber security, but the real thing crept up on me during the COVID-19 pandemic, and I spent a good deal of 2022 pushing myself in various ways to get it under control. It still has its occasional moments, but Iâ€™m in a much better place heading into 2023.</p>

<p>While keeping background stress as low as possible helped with this, I was also anxious in less of a clinical sense about writing. The less you put yourself out there, the less likely it is that youâ€™ll be called out on something, or somebody will tell you that youâ€™re wrong. Inertia is like laying in a safety net.</p>

<h3 id="incremental-improvement">Incremental improvement</h3>

<p>But if youâ€™re sitting still on the net, paralysed out of fear of action and its consequences, youâ€™ll never walk the tightrope. Sure, itâ€™s far less likely that youâ€™ll fail, but youâ€™ll also never do anything remarkable. For all we know, the greatest ideas in history might not be the ones in modern day textbooks - they might never have made it that far, living and dying inside their creatorsâ€™ heads because they were never shared.</p>

<p>I doubt anything I write on these pages will change the world, and most of my ideas are iterations on or combinations of existing ones, rather than fully original thoughts. But even if I have nothing revolutonary to say, the little things that inspire me to put digital pen to paper could still be enough to make our small corner of the world a better place, even if itâ€™s just a tip that saves someone else five minutes.</p>

<p>Some changes in my life have put me what will hopefully be a far better place to trial ideas and implement change in 2023, and I intend to write some more personal, thoughtful posts to share my learnings from these experiments. I still might not be able to go into as much detail as I did a decade ago, but Iâ€™m feeling energetic, inspired, and more motivated to share my experiences than I have been in years.</p>
