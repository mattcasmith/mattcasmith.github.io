<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>I read a lot of books during the COVID-19 lockdown. These ranged from one of the best novels I’ve ever read (<em>South of the Border, West of the Sun</em> by Haruki Murakami) to some more relaxing non-fiction (<em>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels</em> by Jason Schreier). But the pick of the bunch, and the one that has inspired me the most, is <em>Chaos Monkeys: Mayhem and Mania Inside the Silicon Valley Machine</em>, which charts Antonio Garcia Martinez’s journey from Goldman Sachs to start-up founder to Facebook.</p>

<p>The value of this book goes beyond what is physically held within its pages. Martinez referenced so many Googlable concepts, companies, people, and blogs that the thing took me about twice as long to read as any other book (perhaps the best among these was Paul Graham’s blog post How to Start a Start-up, which Martinez described as “a crack-like gateway drug to the startup addiction”).</p>

<p>Without a doubt the most valuable outcome of reading Martinez’s memoir, however, was that it reconnected me with Hacker News. Hacker News is a website run by the start-up accelerator Y Combinator. It functions something like Reddit, with hackers (read: people who like to code and make stuff, not hoodie-wearing, basement-dwelling script kiddies) posting links and upvoting useful content.</p>

<p>By proxy, reconnecting with Hacker News meant reconnecting with the wonderful world of personal blogs run by techy people. I always try to pick up on these because they offer more inspiration and insight than commercial websites, but on the regular internet links to them are few and far between - something I’m acutely aware of with my own blog, which occasionally receives thousands of views in a short space of time thanks to Reddit posts, but does not do too well via search.</p>

<p>[Something about web bloat]</p>

<p>I had been mulling a change of platform - or rather a change away from my previous platform - for quite some time. After all, I am a cyber security professional, and for all its merits WordPress (or at least its plethora of poorly-coded plug-ins) sprouts as many vulnerabilities each month as the most detested corporate software out there. Add to that the overhead of dynamically generating every page as it is requested, which isn’t strictly necessary for a blog that is updated at most once per month, and it was clear that there was a better, more efficient way to do things.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>

<p>With that, I decided to take some inspiration from these small hacker blogs and build something new. But before I started, I needed to think carefully about exacly what I wanted to achieve and how I would do it.</p>

<p>.

<h3 id="building-the-site">Building the site</h3>

<p>.</p>

<p>My initial idea to scratch this minimalist itch was to develop a series of Python scripts that would take data from text files, format them according to some HTML templates, and publish them to my web server.</p>

<p>Then I discovered that Jekyll already did all of that - and it’s much better, and has many more features, than what I would have developed. So I downloaded it, got it running on Linux for Windows, and built the website you’re now reading.</p>

<h3 id="hosting-the-site">Hosting the site</h3>

<p>The next issue was finding somewhere to put it. My hosting provider was cheap and did the job, but it was slightly patchy on support, and getting any type of maintenance performed (i.e. updating PHP to a version WordPress didn’t see as a security risk) required a prompt from me.</p>

<p>Even though it was already cheap, I was another opportunity for efficiency here: Github Pages. I’d never seen this before, but GitHub offers users free hosting for HTML websites, and you can use your own domain. So I made the jump to this free service, saving some money and taking a bet that Microsoft-owned servers would be faster and more reliable than my previous provider’s.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>

<p>All in all, this has worked out pretty well. The process for publishing a new post looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write post in Markdown format in Notepad++</li>
  <li>Run Jekyll to generate the HTML pages</li>
  <li>Move/copy HTML pages to my GitHub repository folder</li>
  <li>Push update to GitHub to publish</li>
</ol>

<p>It’s just as easy as - and in some ways even simpler than - WordPress ever was, and the combination of light, HTML/CSS-only pages and faster servers means a much quicker, cleaner experience for readers.</p>

<p>[Additional benefits: no hosting, always backed up, etc.]</p>
